Monitoring of miner by RF signal

Abstract:
Wireless communication technology is spreading rapidly to all areas of our lives. The technology, which has a wide range of applications from radios, intelligent home systems, automation applications to GPS units, was used in monitoring the workers working in mines in this study. Most of the mining area underground mining is risky and the possibility of accident (gas jams, the explosion and dents, etc.) is the area of high. Locating is vital in this line of work when a sudden accident or dent occurred in which the worker will be known and the position of the recovery efforts can be intensified in that area. It was developed using a wireless receiver, two radio transmitters, and a reference receiver, which are used in the Internet of thinks. CP2102 V2 module was used as the center receiver, D1 mini module was used as the reference receiver, ESP8266-01 was used as the transmitter card and it was used to carry the miner.
